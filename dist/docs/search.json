This feature allows users to configure their own API keys instead of relying on shared TechZone instances that expire after 2 days.\n\n\n\nPreviously, the application used shared API keys from IBM TechZone instances that expire after 2 days. This meant: - Users had to constantly re-reserve TechZone instances - The application would become unusable when keys expired - No way for users to use their own persistent API keys\n\n\n\nImplemented a comprehensive BYOK system that: 1. Stores user-specific API keys securely in the database 2. Shows warning banners when keys are not configured 3. Provides an easy-to-use settings modal for key configuration 4. Includes educational content about obtaining API keys from TechZone\n\n\n\n\n\nCreates the user_api_keys table with: - Fields: - id: UUID primary key - user_id: Foreign key to auth.users - watsonx_api_key: WatsonX.ai API key -

Accordion-based UI for WatsonX.ai and Watson Orchestrate sections - Password-style inputs with show/hide toggle - Pre-filled default URLs - Educational content with links to IBM TechZone - Success/error notifications - Auto-save with upsert functionality\nUser Experience: - Clear instructions on how to obtain API keys - Step-by-step guide for TechZone reservation - Security note about encryption and storage - Smooth save flow with confirmation\n\n\n\nAn actionable notification banner that: - Automatically checks if user has configured API keys - Shows warning when keys are missing - Provides “Configure API Keys” button - Can be dismissed by user - Explains the importance of BYOK - Mentions TechZone expiration issue\nSmart Behavior: -

    "text": "This document summarizes all runtime bugs discovered during user testing and the fixes applied.\n\n\n\n\n\nIssue: Role, skills, and IBM product expertise dropdowns were not functional - dropdowns appeared but had no values.\nRoot Cause: 1. Missing required label prop on MultiSelect components 2. Missing API endpoints - /api/refs/roles, /api/refs/skills, /api/refs/products didn’t exist, causing 404 errors\nFix Applied: - Added label=\"Select skills\" to skills MultiSelect (line 221) - Added label=\"Select products\" to products MultiSelect (line 234) - Added missing API endpoints to server.js: - GET /api/refs/roles - Returns all roles from database - GET /api/refs/skills - Returns all skills from database - GET /api/refs/products - Returns all products from database\nFiles Modified: - your-projects/src/components/carbon/EditProfileModal.tsx - your-projects/api/server.js (lines 99-144)\nImportant: API server must be restarted for changes to take effect.\n\n\n\n\nIssue: Feedback form submission was failing with 400 error.\nRoot Cause: Type field was sending ‘idea’ but database constraint only accepts ‘bug’ or ‘feature’.\nFix Applied: - Changed RadioButton value from ‘idea’ to ‘feature’ (line 89) - Added comprehensive debugging logs throughout submission process - Fixed user_id handling (removed || null, kept just user?.id)\nFiles Modified: - your-projects/src/components/carbon/FeedbackModal.tsx\n\n\n\n\nIssue: WatsonX.ai API key field appeared in both EditProfileModal and dedicated BYOK settings.\nRoot Cause: Duplicate implementation - field was added to profile before BYOK system was created.\nFix Applied: - Removed WatsonX API key field from EditProfileModal (lines 46, 111, 157, 267-275) - Kept only in ApiKeysSettingsModal for centralized BYOK management - Cleaned up related state and save logic\nFiles Modified: - your-projects/src/components/carbon/EditProfileModal.tsx\n\n\n\n\nIssue: Leaders were confused about the difference between “Ambitions” and “Projects” tabs.\nRoot Cause: Tab names were too similar and lacked descriptive context.\nFix Applied: - Renamed “Ambitions” → “Strategic Ambitions” (line 495) - Renamed “Projects” → “All Projects” (line 500) - Added descriptive text to each tab panel explaining purpose: - Strategic Ambitions: “Define your career goals and track progress toward strategic objectives” - All Projects: “View and manage all projects you’re involved in” - Added tab change logging for debugging\nFiles Modified: - your-projects/src/components/carbon/AmbitionsTab.tsx\n\n\n\n\nIssue: React warning about invalid DOM property on ModalFooter.\nRoot Cause: Carbon Design System’s ModalFooter doesn’t support secondaryButtonDisabled prop.\nFix Applied: - Removed secondaryButtonDisabled={uploading} prop from ResumeUploadModal (line 1770) - Carbon only supports primaryButtonDisabled, not secondary button disabling\nFiles Modified: - your-projects/src/components/carbon/LeadershipTab.tsx\n\n\n\n\nIssue: React warning about duplicate key props when spreading getHeaderProps and getRowProps.\nRoot Cause: Spread operator includes key prop, but we were also explicitly setting key={header.key} and key={row.id}.\nFix Applied: - Destructured and excluded key from spread in all DataTable instances: tsx   const { key, ...headerProps } = getHeaderProps({ header });   const { key, ...rowProps } = getRowProps({ row }); - Applied to both main user table and library table\nFiles Modified: - your-projects/src/components/carbon/LeadershipTab.tsx (lines 1010-1026, 1038-1217, 1438-1448, 1463-1470)\n\n\n\n\nIssue: TypeScript errors about missing required children prop in ModalFooter.\nRoot Cause: Comments indicated empty children but weren’t actually providing them.\nFix Applied: - Replaced comments with actual empty fragment &lt;&gt;&lt;/&gt; in all ModalFooter instances - Fixed 3 instances in LeadershipTab.tsx\nFiles Modified: - your-projects/src/components/carbon/LeadershipTab.tsx\n\n\n\n\nIssue: TypeScript errors for new tables (career_paths, user_path_preferences, project_invitations, feedback).\nRoot Cause: Tables added via migrations but type definitions not regenerated.\nFix Applied: - Added as any type casting to Supabase queries for new tables - Documented need for proper type generation in production\nFiles Modified: - your-projects/src/components/carbon/AmbitionsTab.tsx - your-projects/src/components/carbon/FeedbackModal.tsx\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll modified components now include detailed console logs for debugging:\n\nEditProfileModal:\n\nReference data loading (roles, skills, products)\nProfile data loading\nSave operation tracking\nError handling\n\nFeedbackModal:\n\nForm submission tracking\nUser authentication status\nType field validation\nAPI response handling\n\nAmbitionsTab:\n\nTab change events\nProject fetching operations\nData loading states\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest EditProfileModal dropdowns (role, skills, products)\nSubmit feedback with different types (bug, feature)\nNavigate between Strategic Ambitions and All Projects tabs\nVerify no React warnings in browser console\nTest BYOK settings (API keys only in dedicated modal)\nCheck browser console for debugging logs\n\n\n\n\n\nNo React warnings about invalid DOM props\nNo React warnings about duplicate keys\nNo TypeScript errors in development mode\nDebugging logs appear for all operations\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nyour-projects/src/components/carbon/EditProfileModal.tsx\n\nFixed MultiSelect labels\nRemoved redundant API key field\nAdded comprehensive debugging logs\n\nyour-projects/src/components/carbon/FeedbackModal.tsx\n\nFixed type field value\nFixed user_id handling\nAdded debugging logs\n\nyour-projects/src/components/carbon/AmbitionsTab.tsx\n\nImproved tab naming\nAdded descriptive text\nAdded debugging logs\nFixed TypeScript errors\n\nyour-projects/src/components/carbon/LeadershipTab.tsx\n\nFixed React key prop warnings\nFixed invalid DOM prop warning\nFixed TypeScript children errors\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest in Browser: Verify all fixes work as expected\nMonitor Console: Check for any remaining warnings or errors\nUser Acceptance: Have users test the fixed functionality\nCommit Changes: Push all fixes to repository\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll fixes maintain backward compatibility\nNo breaking changes to existing functionality\nEnhanced debugging will help identify future issues faster\nType casting with as any is temporary - proper type generation recommended for production"

Missing API endpoints - /api/refs/roles, /api/refs/skills, /api/refs/products didn’t exist, causing 404 errors\nFix Applied: - Added label=\"Select skills\" to skills MultiSelect (line 221) - Added label=\"Select products\" to products MultiSelect (line 234) - Added missing API endpoints to server.js: - GET /api/refs/roles - Returns all roles from database - GET /api/refs/skills - Returns all skills from database - GET /api/refs/products - Returns all products from database\nFiles Modified: - your-projects/src/components/carbon/EditProfileModal.tsx - your-projects/api/server.js (lines 99-144)\nImportant: API server must be restarted for changes to take effect.\n\n\n\n\nIssue: Feedback form submission was failing with 400 error.\nRoot Cause: Type field was sending ‘idea’ but database constraint only accepts ‘bug’ or ‘feature’.\nFix Applied: - Changed RadioButton value from ‘idea’ to ‘feature’ (line 89) - Added comprehensive debugging logs throughout submission process - Fixed user_id handling (removed || null, kept just user?.id)\nFiles Modified: - your-projects/src/components/carbon/FeedbackModal.tsx\n\n\n\n\nIssue: WatsonX.ai API key field appeared in both EditProfileModal and dedicated BYOK settings.\nRoot Cause: Duplicate implementation - field was added to profile before BYOK system was created.\nFix Applied: - Removed WatsonX API key field from EditProfileModal (lines 46, 111, 157, 267-275) - Kept only in ApiKeysSettingsModal for centralized BYOK management - Cleaned up related state and save logic\nFiles Modified: - your-projects/src/components/carbon/EditProfileModal.tsx\n\n\n\n\nIssue: Leaders were confused about the difference between “Ambitions” and “Projects” tabs.\nRoot Cause: Tab names were too similar and lacked descriptive context.\nFix Applied: - Renamed “Ambitions” → “Strategic Ambitions” (line 495) - Renamed “Projects” → “All Projects” (line 500) - Added descriptive text to each tab panel explaining purpose: - Strategic Ambitions: “Define your career goals and track progress toward strategic objectives” - All Projects: “View and manage all projects you’re involved in” - Added tab change logging for debugging\nFiles Modified: - your-projects/src/components/carbon/AmbitionsTab.tsx\n\n\n\n\nIssue: React warning about invalid DOM property on ModalFooter.\nRoot Cause: Carbon Design System’s ModalFooter doesn’t support secondaryButtonDisabled prop.\nFix Applied: - Removed secondaryButtonDisabled={uploading} prop from ResumeUploadModal (line 1770) - Carbon only supports primaryButtonDisabled, not secondary button disabling\nFiles Modified: - your-projects/src/components/carbon/LeadershipTab.tsx\n\n\n\n\nIssue: React warning about duplicate key props when spreading getHeaderProps and getRowProps.\nRoot Cause: Spread operator includes key prop, but we were also explicitly setting key={header.key} and key={row.id}.\nFix Applied: - Destructured and excluded key from spread in all DataTable instances: tsx   const { key, ...headerProps } = getHeaderProps({ header });   const { key, ...rowProps } = getRowProps({ row }); - Applied to both main user table and library table\nFiles Modified: - your-projects/src/components/carbon/LeadershipTab.tsx (lines 1010-1026, 1038-1217, 1438-1448, 1463-1470)\n\n\n\n\nIssue: TypeScript errors about missing required children prop in ModalFooter.\nRoot Cause: Comments indicated empty children but weren’t actually providing them.\nFix Applied: - Replaced comments with actual empty fragment &lt;&gt;&lt;/&gt; in all ModalFooter instances - Fixed 3 instances in LeadershipTab.tsx\nFiles Modified: - your-projects/src/components/carbon/LeadershipTab.tsx\n\n\n\n\nIssue: TypeScript errors for new tables (career_paths, user_path_preferences, project_invitations, feedback).\nRoot Cause: Tables added via migrations but type definitions not regenerated.\nFix Applied: - Added as any type casting to Supabase queries for new tables - Documented need for proper type generation in production\nFiles Modified: - your-projects/src/components/carbon/AmbitionsTab.tsx - your-projects/src/components/carbon/FeedbackModal.tsx"

Additionally, there was a type mismatch where the code used \"feature\" but the database constraint only allows \"bug\" or \"idea\".\n\n\n\nFile: FeedbackModal.tsx\n\nRemoved explicit priority field (line 102):\n\nThe priority column has a DEFAULT value in the database ('medium')\nNo need to specify it explicitly in the insert operation\nThis avoids the schema cache issue\n\nFixed type mismatch (lines 31, 168, 177-178):\n\nChanged type from \"bug\" | \"feature\" to \"bug\" | \"idea\"\nUpdated radio button value from \"feature\" to \"idea\"\nUpdated radio button ID from \"type-feature\" to \"type-idea\"\nThis matches the database CHECK constraint: type IN ('bug', 'idea')\n\n\n\n\n\n// Before\nconst [type, setType] = useState&lt;\"bug\" | \"feature\"&gt;(\"bug\");\npriority: type === \"bug\" ? \"medium\" : \"low\",\n\n// After\nconst [type, setType] = useState&lt;\"bug\" | \"idea\"&gt;(\"bug\");\n// priority has a DEFAULT value in the database, so we don't need to specify it\n\n\n\nFrom 20251112000001_create_feedback_table.sql:\npriority TEXT DEFAULT 'medium' CHECK (priority IN ('low', 'medium', 'high', 'critical')),\ntype TEXT NOT NULL CHECK (type IN ('bug', 'idea')),\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsers were unable to save API keys, receiving authentication errors even when logged in. The error message asked users to “login/logout and try again.”\n\n\n\nThe authentication flow in ApiKeysSettingsModal.tsx wasn’t properly validating the session before attempting to save. This could lead to: - Stale session tokens - Missing session validation - Unclear error messages for users\n\n\n\nFile: ApiKeysSettingsModal.tsx\nEnhanced the handleSave() function with:\n\nSession Validation First (lines 145-156):\n\nCheck session validity before attempting user operations\nProvide clear error messages if session is invalid\nAdded comprehensive logging for debugging\n\nBetter Error Handling (lines 172-186):\n\nSpecific error messages based on error codes\nCode 42501: Permission denied (migration not applied)\nCode 23505: Duplicate entry\nDetailed console logging for troubleshooting\n\nExplicit NULL Handling (lines 163-169):\n\nConvert empty strings to null for database consistency\nPrevents issues with empty string vs null comparisons\n\nEnhanced Debugging (throughout):\n\nAdded emoji-prefixed console logs for easy filtering\nLog session validation, user authentication, and upsert operations\nInclude error codes, messages, and hints in error logs\n\n\n\n\n\n// Added session validation\nconst { data: { session }, error: sessionError } = await supabase.auth.getSession();\n\nif (sessionError) {\n    throw new Error(\"Session error.

The database migration may not have been applied yet.\");\n} else if (upsertError.code === \"23505\") {\n    throw new Error(\"Duplicate entry detected. Please try again.\");\n}\n\n\n\nFrom 20251112180000_create_user_api_keys_table.sql:\nCREATE POLICY \"Users can insert own API keys\"\n    ON user_api_keys\n    FOR INSERT\n    WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = user_id);\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOpen Feedback Modal\nSelect “Bug Report” type\nFill in title and description\nSubmit feedback\nVerify success message appears\nCheck database for new feedback entry with default priority\n\n\n\n\n\nOpen API Keys Settings Modal\nEnter WatsonX.ai API key and Project ID\nClick “Save Keys”\nVerify success message appears\nCheck browser console for detailed logs\nReload page and verify keys are persisted\nTest with empty session (logout/login)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnsure these migrations are applied to production: 1. 20251112000001_create_feedback_table.sql - Feedback table with priority column 2. 20251112180000_create_user_api_keys_table.sql - User API keys table with RLS policies\n\n\n\nIf issues occur: 1.
